## Exercise 11: Using Network Watcher to Test and Validate Connectivity

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will collect the flow log and perform connectivity from your simulated on-premises environment to Azure. This will be accomplished by using the Network Watcher Service in the Azure Platform.

### Task 1: Configuring the Storage Account for the NSG Flow Logs

1. On the Azure portal select **+ Create a resource**. Select **Storage Account**.

2. On the **Create Storage account** blade. Enter the following information, and select **Review + Create** then select the **Create** button:

    -  Subscription: **Your Subscription**

    -  Resource Group: **MonitoringRG** (Use the existing resource group created earlier.)

    -  Storage Account Name: **This must be Unique and alphanumeric, lowercase and no special characters.**

    -  Location: **South Central US**

    -  Performance: **Standard**

    -  Account Kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -  Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    ![In this screenshot, the 'Create storage account' blade is depicted with the above required settings selected along with the 'Review + create' button.](images/accountstorage1.png "Add storage account")

   >**Note:** Ensure the storage account is created before continuing.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, but select **East US** for the region and give it a different name.

4. On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking** then select **Network Watcher**.

5. From the **Network Watcher** blade under the **Logs** menu on the left, select **NSG flow logs**. Select **+ Create**. 

    ![In this screenshot, the 'NSG Flow logs blade is depicted with the '+ Create' button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image185.png "Network Security Groups in Flow Log")

6. In the **Create a flow log** blade that appears, enter the following information then select **Next: Configuration**.

    - Subscription: **Select your subscription**

    - Network Security Group: **WGAppNSG1**

    - Storage Accounts: **The available storage account that you created earlier**.

    - Retention (days): **0**

    ![In this screenshot, the Basics tab of the 'Create a flow log' blade is depicted with the required settings listed above selected along with the 'Next: Configuration' button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/CreateFL.png "Create a flow log Basics")

7. On the **Configuration** tab of the **Create a flow log** blade, enter the following information then select **Review + create** then **Create**. 

    - Flow Logs Version: **Version 2**

    - Enable Traffic Analytics: **Checked**

    - Traffic Analytics processing interval: **Every 10 minutes**

    - Log Analytics Workspace: **The log analytics workspace you created earlier*

8.  Repeat Steps 5 - 7 to create a flow log for the **OnPremVM-nsg** Network Security Group as well. When completed your **NSG flow logs** blade on **Network Watcher** should look like what's depicted in the below image.

     ![In this screenshot, the 'Network Watcher - NSG flow logs' blade is depicted with the two flow logs created earlier listed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image189.png "Network Watcher Flow Log")

9.  Navigate back to the **OnPremVM**. Connect to it by downloading and opening the RDP file. 
    
10. Install the **Edge** browser on the **OnPremVM** by opening **PowerShell** and running the following commands.  The first command will force TLS 1.2 use for PowerShell:
    
    ```
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

    [enum]::GetNames([System.Net.SecurityProtocolType])
        
    md -Path $env:temp\edgeinstall -erroraction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null
    $Download = join-path $env:temp\edgeinstall MicrosoftEdgeEnterpriseX64.msi

    Invoke-WebRequest 'https://msedge.sf.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com/filestreamingservice/files/a2662b5b-97d0-4312-8946-598355851b3b/MicrosoftEdgeEnterpriseX64.msi'  -OutFile $Download

    Start-Process "$Download" -ArgumentList "/quiet /passive"

11. Open the **Edge** browser and navigate to portal.azure.com.  Login to the **Azure** portal.
    
12. In the RDP session for the **OnPremVM**, navigate to the **Azure** portal, navigate to **Virtual machines** and select the **WGWEB1**. Connect to **WGWEB1** through **Bastion**.  In **WGWEB1**,  navigate to the load balancer's private ip address (**10.8.0.100**) and generate some traffic by refreshing the browser. Allow ten minutes to pass for traffic analytics to generate.  

     ![In this screenshot, the RDP connections to OnPremVM and WGWEB1 are depicted with the load balancer connection open.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image190.png "CloudShop Application")


### Task 2: Configuring Diagnostic Logs

1. On the Azure portal, select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking**, then **Network Watcher**,

2. Select **Diagnostic Logs** from the **Logs Menu** within the blade.

     ![In this screenshot, the 'Network Watcher - Diagnostic logs' blade of the Azure portal is depicted with 'Diagnostic logs' selected under 'Logs' on the left](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image192.png "Network Watcher Diagnostic Log")

3. Select **onpremvm*NNN*** then select **+Add diagnostic setting**.

4. Enter **OnPremDiag** as the name then select the checkbox for **Archive to a storage account**. On the **Storage accounts** drop down, select the available storage account you created earlier.

3. Select the **green check mark** which identifies your network. Within the pop-up menu select **More Details** to propagate detailed information of the flow to and from your network.

     ![In this screenshot, the Traffic Analytics Geo Map View is depicted with a green check mark on the region where your network resides and monitor metrics displayed next to it.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image197.png "Your Network Environment")

>**Note:** You can select the **See More** link to query the connections detail for more information.

### Task 4: Network Connection Troubleshooting

1. On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. From the Categories menu select **Networking** then select **Network Watcher**.

2. Select **Connection Troubleshoot** from the **Network Diagnostic tools** menu.

3. To troubleshoot a connection or to validate the route enter the following information and select **Check**:
   
    -  Subscription: **Your Subscription**

    -  Resource Group: **OnPremVMRG**

    -  Source Type: **Virtual Machine**

    -  Virtual Machine: **OnPremVM**

    -  Destination: **Select a virtual machine**
 
    -  Resource Group: **WGVNetRG2**
 
    -  Virtual Machine: **WGWEB1**

    -  Destination Port: **80**

     ![In this screenshot, the 'Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot' blade is depicted with the required settings listed above selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image198.png "Connection Troubleshoot")

4. Once the check is complete the connection troubleshoot feature will display a grid view on the name, IP Address Status and Next hop as seen in the following screenshot. 

     ![In this screenshot, the results of the connection troubleshoot operation performed in the previous step is depicted with a grid view showing the name, IP Address Status, and Next hop IP address.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image199.png "Connection Troubleshoot")
